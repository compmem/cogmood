[b]Informed Consent Agreement[/b]


[b]Please read this consent agreement carefully before you decide to participate in the study.[/b]

[b]Purpose of the research study:[/b] The purpose of the study is to learn more about different aspects of human memory. In other words, we are interested in how patterns of behavioral and neural activity affect changes in context between encoding and retrieval, lag recency effects in episodic and semantic memory, serial position effects, and the effects of stimulus characteristics such as word frequency and semantic relatedness.
[b]What you will do in the study:[/b] In this study, we hope to better understand how people remember recently experienced events by examining behavior and neural activity as participants encode information into memory and retrieve information from memory.

In this study you will:
1. Complete the consent forms and ensure you fully understand the study procedure
2. Study lists of words presented by a computer
3. Complete a series of arithmetic or reasoning problems or questionnaires

[b]Time required:[/b] The study will require about 1 hour of your time.
[b]Risks:[/b] There are no known risks. You will be able to speak to investigators at any time during the procedures if you have any concerns or difficulties.
[b]Benefits:[/b] There are no direct benefits to you from participation in this study. This study may help us understand the processes involved in making decisions and retrieving memories.
[b]Confidentiality:[/b] The information that you give in the study will be handled confidentially. Your data will be anonymous, which means that your name will not be collected or linked to the data. Your data will be reported in a way that will not identify you.

Debriefing

As we go about our daily lives, we form memories by binding information to the context (i.e. a particular place and time)
in which we experience it. To recall details of a specific event, we must mentally time travel back to the context of the
event in order to cue our memory system. In our research, we aim to determine what parts of context are important for
forming and retrieving memory. We investigate this by manipulating different aspects of information and how it is
presented, and then observing changes in memory behavior.

In this study, you were asked to look at information, such as words and/or pictures, and then recall or recognize the items
that you studied.  In some cases, the items you look at may have been related to one another and in some cases not.
We are particularly interested in the effect inter-item relatedness has on how the brain represents the context of an
event, and how it affects memory storage and retrieval.

In order to maintain the integrity of this study, we ask that you please do not discuss your experiences in the experiment with
other students who could potentially be participants. If others know all details of the study before participating, it could
affect the results in unexpected ways.

If you have any questions about this study, please do not hesitate to ask your experimenter now. You may also contact
Dr. Per B. Sederberg, pbs5u@virginia.edu.
