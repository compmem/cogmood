Occasionally a negative reward will appear. When that happens, you have to
choose whether to pay that amount from the bank to continue pumping, or refuse
to pay, and collect what's in the balloon. The keys are still J to keep pumping,
and K to stop and collect.

Balloons come in bags of 8. There will be 3 bags total, with a stop in-between
each bag.

A FEW THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE RISKS AND REWARDS:
 - Some balloons have higher quality and some have lower quality. Higher-
   quality balloons are less risky and can be pumped longer before popping.
   Lower-quality balloons are more risky and can be pumped less before popping.
   All of the balloons become more risky the longer you pump them (just like a
   real balloon gets more likely to pop the more air you put into it).
 - Balloons are drawn from "bags" of 8. All the balloons in any given bag have
   similar quality. Once the current bag is used up, you will be notified
   that a new bag is being opened. The balloons in the new bag will again be
   similar to each other in terms of quality - but may be much higher or lower
   in quality than the previous bag.
 - The rewards will change each pump: Sometimes higher, sometimes lower, so pay
   close attention!
 - The rewards are NOT connected to the risk. High risk does NOT necessarily
   mean high reward, low risk does NOT necessarily mean low reward. They may
   sometimes move in the same direction by chance, but the processes that
   determine risk and reward are separate from each other.
