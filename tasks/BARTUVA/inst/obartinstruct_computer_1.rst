Balloon Task
============

In this task you will be playing a balloon-pumping game. The object of the game
is to make as much money as possible by inflating the balloon. Each successful
pump puts some amount of money into the balloon, and you can put this money in
the bank on later turns. However, there is always a risk that the balloon will
pop before you can put the money in the bank.

In the center of the screen you will see a pump and your first balloon. To the
right is the bank.

Each turn, a fixation cross ("+") will appear in the center of the pump. Focus
on the cross when it appears. It will disappear and be replaced with a reward.
The reward is how much money will be added to the balloon if you pump this turn.

When you see the reward appear, you must choose to either press the
%s key with your left hand to PUMP, or the %s key with your right hand
to STOP AND COLLECT.

If you pump, the balloon might inflate and with the reward added to it, or it
might pop, making all the money in the balloon disappear. If it pops, you start
the next turn with a new, empty balloon.

If you stop, no money is added to the balloon, and the money which is already
in the balloon is put in the bank. Next turn you start with a new, empty
balloon from the bag.

IMPORTANT:  WHEN A REWARD APPEARS, THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU HAVE IN THE BANK WILL
DROP BEGIN TO DROP UNTIL YOU MAKE A DECISION. BOTH THE PUMPING AND COLLECTING
ACTIONS WILL STOP MONEY FROM LEAVING THE BANK UNTIL THE NEXT REWARD APPEARS.

Press %s to continue.
