Balloon Task
============

There will be 36 Balloons in each block.

A FEW THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE RISKS AND REWARDS:
 - Some balloons have higher quality and some have lower quality. Higher-
   quality balloons are less risky and can be pumped longer before popping.
   Lower-quality balloons are more risky and can be pumped less before popping.
   All of the balloons become more risky the longer you pump them (just like a
   real balloon gets more likely to pop the more air you put into it).
 - Balloons are drawn from one of three "bags" of 12 balloons. All the balloons
   in a given bag have the same color and a similar quality. You need to keep
   track of the quality of the different colors in order to make better-informed
   judgments of when you should pump or collect.
 - The rewards will change each pump: Sometimes higher, sometimes lower, so pay
   close attention!
 - The rewards are NOT connected to the risk. High risk does NOT necessarily
   mean high reward, low risk does NOT necessarily mean low reward. They may
   sometimes move in the same direction by chance, but the processes that
   determine risk and reward are separate from each other.
