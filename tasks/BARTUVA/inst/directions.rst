============

In this task you will be playing a balloon-pumping game. The object of the game
is to make as much money as possible by inflating the balloon. Each successful
pump puts some amount of money into the balloon, and you can put this money in
the bank on later turns. However, there is always a risk that the balloon will
pop before you can put the money in the bank.

In the center of the screen you will see a pump and your first balloon. To the
right is the bank.

Each turn, a fixation cross ("+") will appear in the center of the pump. Focus
on the cross when it appears. It will disappear and be replaced with a reward.
The reward is how much money will be added to the balloon if you pump this turn.

When you see the reward appear, you must choose to either press
G to PUMP, or H to STOP AND COLLECT.

If you pump, the balloon might inflate and with the reward added to it, or it
might pop, making all the money in the balloon disappear. If it pops, you start
the next turn with a new, empty balloon.

If you stop, no money is added to the balloon, and the money which is already
in the balloon is put in the bank. Next turn you start with a new, empty
balloon from the bag.

Occasionally a negative reward will appear. When that happens, you have to
choose whether to pay that amount from the bank to continue pumping, or refuse
to pay, and collect what's in the balloon. The keys are still J to keep pumping,
and K to stop and collect.

Balloons come in bags of 10. There will be 3 bags total, with a stop in-between
each bag.

A FEW THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE RISKS AND REWARDS:
 - Some balloons have higher quality and some have lower quality. Higher-
   quality balloons are less risky and can be pumped longer before popping.
   Lower-quality balloons are more risky and can be pumped less before popping.
   All of the balloons become more risky the longer you pump them (just like a
   real balloon gets more likely to pop the more air you put into it).
 - Balloons are drawn from "bags" of 10 balloons. All the balloons in any given bag have
   similar quality. Once the current bag is used up, you will be notified
   that a new bag is being opened. The balloons in the new bag will again be
   similar to each other in terms of quality - but may be much higher or lower
   in quality than the previous bag.
 - The rewards will change each pump: Sometimes higher, sometimes lower, so pay
   close attention!
 - The rewards are NOT connected to the risk. High risk does NOT necessarily
   mean high reward, low risk does NOT necessarily mean low reward. They may
   sometimes move in the same direction by chance, but the processes that
   determine risk and reward are separate from each other.
