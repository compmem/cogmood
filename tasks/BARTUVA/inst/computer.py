text_0 = """In this task you will try to make as much money as possible by
inflating balloons. On every turn, you may either PUMP a balloon or STOP AND
COLLECT the money you've already earned. If you decide to pump the balloon, you
may earn some more money, or the balloon may pop. If it pops you will lose all
the money you've earned for that balloon.

If you stop and collect, the money you've already earned will be saved in the
bank, and you will be given a new balloon.

Don't take too long to decide whether to pump or stop, because the amount of
money in the bank will decrease with time."""

text_1 = """Keep in mind that the money you could earn by pumping will be
different every time, so pay close attention! In addition, you will notice that
balloons come in different colors. The different colors indicate how strong
each balloon is. Stronger balloons can be pumped more before popping. You will
need to learn which balloons are stronger and which are weaker by paying
attention to the colors."""

text_2 = """Here is an example of what the task looks like. In the center of
the screen is a pump and a balloon. To the side is the bank. The amount of
money you could earn by successfully pumping the balloon will be shown
on the pump itself. The amount of money that could be added to the bank by
collecting will be displayed within the balloon itself.

You could PUMP the balloon by pressing the %s key with one hand, or you
could STOP AND COLLECT the money you've already earned by pressing the %s key
with your other hand."""
