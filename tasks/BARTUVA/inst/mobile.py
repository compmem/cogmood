          is to make as much money as possible by inflating the balloon. Each successful\n\
          pump puts some amount of money into the balloon, and you can put this money in\n\
          the bank on later turns. However, there is always a risk that the balloon will\n\
          pop before you can put the money in the bank.'

          on the cross when it appears. It will disappear and be replaced with a reward.\n\
          The reward is how much money will be added to the balloon if you pump this turn.'

          - Some balloons have higher quality and some have lower quality. Higher-\n\
          quality balloons are less risky and can be pumped more before popping.\n\
          Lower-quality balloons are more risky and can be pumped less before popping.\n\
          All of the balloons become more risky the more you pump them (just like a\n\
          real balloon gets more likely to pop the more air you put into it).\n\
          - Balloons are drawn from one of %s "bags" of %s balloons. All the balloons\n\
          in a given bag have the same color and a similar quality. You need to keep\n\
          track of the quality of the different colors in order to make better-informed\n\
          judgments of when you should pump or collect.\n\
          - The rewards will change each pump: Sometimes higher, sometimes lower, so pay\n\
          close attention!\n\
          - The rewards are NOT connected to the risk. High risk does NOT necessarily\n\
          mean high reward, low risk does NOT necessarily mean low reward. They may\n\
          sometimes move in the same direction by chance, but the processes that\n\
          determine risk and reward are separate from each other.'
