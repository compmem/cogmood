Memory Task Instructions
========================

In the memory task you will see pairs of objects side by side and be asked to indicate whether each pair is "new" or "old."

A pair is "old" only if it is **exactly** the same as a pair you saw earlier in the task.

Be very careful, because sometimes you will have seen both objects, but not in that exact pairing. If the objects are paired differently, or if you have not seen the objects before, the pair is "new."

You will use both of your hands to respond. If the pair is "old," %s
with your left hand; if the pair is "new," %s with your right hand.

You will need to make a response for every pair that you see. Please respond as
accurately as possible, but you will only have 2.5 seconds to respond, so don't
wait too long!
